This includes hints on getting both your students and mentors up to speed on Scrach. The site includes lesson plans and sample programs designed to be consitent with both the Pyton and Robots groups. If you hear of any good tools, please let us know. Target Audience Learning Scratch is ideal for students that don not yet have good keyboarding skills. Once students master using the shift keys and keyboard functions like copy and pasting text we suggest they move on to learing Python with turtle graphcs. List of Concepts Here are some of the concepts we will be learning in this course. If you are already familiar with these concepts you can skip over some of the labs. events capture an event such as clicking the run program button or a keyboard press. screen motion moving forward and turning with parameters such as distance and angle. square walk - teach your sprit to walk in a square and draw figures. variables Variables make our programs easier to read and easier to understand. loops Loops help use when we have many tasks that we repeat over and over. conditionals Conditionals allow us to change our behavior based on rules we create. random numbers Random number functions allow our programs to have the computer select new random number between a range of numbers. inputs Inputs allow us to prompt the user for values. Contributing to Our Library Do you have a specific example you would like to share with other students and teachers? Please see the Contributing menu for details on how to share your code.","title":"CoderDojo Twin Cities Scratch Resources"},{"location":"#coderdojo-twin-cities-scratch-resources","text":"This GitHub repository is for sharing teaching resources to teach Scratch.

Once they have keyboarding skills we suggest they move on to learning turtle graphics with Python. Before you begin your mentoring session we recommend you do the following: Go to the scratch web site: http://scratch.mit.edu/ Create your own account for yourself and suggest that each student create their account with the help of their parent or guardian. Get familiar with the layout and functions of the site. Make sure you know how to go to the lower-left corner of the web page to add the \"Pen\" extension for drawing lines.
