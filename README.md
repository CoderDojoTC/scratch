## Scratch Resources

This repository contains resources for the Scratch code group at CoderDojo Twin Cities.

New mentors, please check out these 6 short [Scratch Basics for New Mentors](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/scratch/wiki/New-Scratch-Mentors-Start-Here) before you come to mentor. Experienced mentors -- we'd love your feedback and favorite tips.  Please send to hello@CoderDojoTC.org

Check out the [mentor-resource repository](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/mentor-resources) for tips on mentoring and other useful information.

Once you are at CoderDojoTC, there are laminated [Scratch cards](http://scratch.mit.edu/help/cards/) in one of the plastic bins -- find them and make them available to the students.

### Create an Account Handouts

We've created a [handout](handouts/scratch-make-an-account.docx) to help students create and remember their account details.

Thank you for mentoring at CoderDojoTC!
