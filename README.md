# Scratch Resources

This repository contains resources for the Scratch code group at CoderDojo Twin Cities.

New (and experienced) mentors, please check out these [basics of Scratch](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/scratch/wiki/New-Scratch-Mentors-Start-Here) before you come to mentor. 

There are laminated [Scratch cards](http://scratch.mit.edu/help/cards/) in one of the plastic bins -- find them and make them available to the students.

Check out the [mentor-resource repository](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/mentor-resources) for tips on mentoring and other useful information.
