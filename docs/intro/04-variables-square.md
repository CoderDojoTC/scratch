# Draw A Square With Variables
You will note that the distance we move, the angle we turn and the time we wait
are all repeated many times in the program.  It is hard to maintain the
code if we have to remember to change the program in many places.

What if we could change a single place in the program and have the entire
program change its behavior?  This is one use of variables.

Next, we will create a distance variable:

Next, look for the "Set Variable" block and move it under the pendown block.  Type in "100" to the value.
![Set Distance to 100](../img/set-distance-to-100.png)

Next, drag the distance variable into the Move Foward Block
