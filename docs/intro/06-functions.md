## Link to Working Program
[Turtle Square Function](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/410623444/)

Now put four squares on the screen in different locations
## Experiments

1. How would you modify the program so that there is no line drawn between the squares?

2. Could you put the penup and pendown blocks in the function
