# Getting Started with Scratch
Scratch is ideal for students that want to learn the principals of programming before they have keyboarding skills.  Once they have keyboarding skills we suggest they move on to learning turtle graphics with Python.

Before you begin your mentoring session we recommend you do the following:

1. Go to the scratch web site:<br/><br/>
http://scratch.mit.edu/
2. Create your own account for yourself and suggest that each student create their account with the help of their parent or guardian.
3. Get familiar with the layout and functions of the site.  Make sure you know how to go to the lower-left corner of the
web page to add the "Pen" extension for drawing lines.
4. Get familiar with each of the types of blocks.
