# Getting Started with Scratch
Scratch is ideal for students that want to learn the principals of programming before they have keyboarding skills.  Once they have keyboarding skills we suggest they move on to learning turtle graphics with Python.


Before you begin your mentoring session we recommend you do the following:

## Setup Account on Scratch Site

1. Go to the scratch web site:<br/><br/>
http://scratch.mit.edu/
2. Create your own account for yourself and suggest that each student create their account with the help of their parent or guardian.
3. Get familiar with the layout and functions of the site.  Make sure you know how to go to the lower-left corner of the
web page to add the "Pen" extension for drawing lines.
4. Get familiar with each of the types of blocks.

## Adding the Pen Extension

To be consistent with the other labs we are using the fast-feedback drawing with turtle graphics philosophy.  Unfortunately, the MIT Scratch 3.0 user interface does not enable the Pen drawing blocks in the default user menu.  This
must be done before you can add the pendown block.

To do this, go to the lower-left corner of the screen.  There will be a blue box. If you hover over it, it will
show that this is the "Add Extension" control.

After you click on the Add Extension control you will see a grid of extensions.  You want to then find the Pen Extension card and click on that.

After you click this you must use the Back Icon at the top-left corner of the screen.

When you are back to the main screen you should now see the Pen blocks on the lower left of the blocks menu.
